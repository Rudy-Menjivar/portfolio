            Greetings! I'm currently adding to my coding skills as a student at UC Davis. I'm knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, APIs, MySQL, MongoDB and React (to name a few).
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be graduating in the spring of 2021, with enough skills to work as a Full Stack Web Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            My future plans also include helping small businesses setup their online presence or at the very least, improving it. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact with every client that I work with, building those relationships to naturally gain referrals to help more clients.
        </p>
